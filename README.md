# Anime ASCII Arts in Obfuscated C/C++  
  
This repository contains a collection of obfuscated C/C++ programs that **look like anime characters**.  
Each source file is carefully crafted so that the code itself forms an ASCII art image, often inspired by anime, games, or other characters.  
Some programs are executable, while others serve purely as visual obfuscation.  
  
## Programs  
  
### 1. Sinon  
- C program forming an ASCII art of `Sinon` from Sword Art Online.  
- Some code sections playable as a timing-based game with different compiler optimization levels.  
- Platforms: Linux, Cygwin, JS/Linux (various GCC and Clang versions).  
- [Details](./sinon/README.md)  
  
### 2. Nyaruko  
- C program forming an ASCII art of `Nyaruko`.  
- Converts binary input into C code that reproduces the input, with embedded encryption.  
- Platforms: Linux, Windows (Cygwin, MingW), JSLinux.  
- [Details](./nyaruko/README.md)  
  
### 3. Hitoya
- C program forming an ASCII art of `Mile` from "Didn't I Say to Make My Abilities Average in the Next Life?!".  
- Uses a PIN-based compile-time encoding to reproduce input bytes.  
- Platforms: Linux, Cygwin, JSLinux.  
- [Details](./hitoya/README.md)  
  
### 4. Fuuko  
- C/C++ program forming ASCII art of a sea star (`Fuuko`).  
- Output patterns vary by compiler dialect: C90 (sea star), C99 (eyes), C++98 (dango), C++11 (circles), C11 (none).  
- Platforms: Linux, Cygwin, JS/Linux.  
- [Details](./fuuko/README.md)  
  
### 5. Akari  
- C program forming an ASCII art of `Akari`.  
- Downsamples images or source code into new programs that retain ASCII-art formatting.  
- Supports chaining and rot13 filters for text transformations.  
- Platforms: Linux, Cygwin, JS/Linux.  
- [Details](./araki/README.md)
